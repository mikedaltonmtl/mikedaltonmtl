<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code a 2D, Legend of Zelda-type game, using CSS and Javascript.</p>
<p>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything level-appropriate, preferably as a way to learn TypeScript.</p>
<p>ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with (believe it or not!) learning TypeScript.</p>
